# Raspberry Pi Smart Mirror
This is the Smart Mirror that I built during my time at BlueStamp Engineering. It's a screen embedded behind a piece of mirrored acrylic and can show the user the time, news, weather, and holidays while remaining a mirror at the same time. It uses MagicMirror software commonly used by other smart mirrors in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi 4b to create a project that is both compact and elegant.

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I've added additional functionality to the Smart Mirror Software as well as a few modifications.
- Technical details: I've added my home wifi in the top left corner as a new module modification as well as a world clock in the middle left.
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Challenges: This project marks my first time ever working with a Raspberry Pi/Linux like operating system. So it was a little tricky learning to work around and use the terminal effectively compared to using windows.
- I'm looking to finish modifications to the mirror and have my final milestone be actually assembling the mirror as a tangible object.

# First Milestone
I plan to build the Smart Mirror with the open source MagicMirror software for the Raspberry Pi
- The only component so far is the raspberry pi since I'm working on the software first.
- Technical progress: I have configured time, calendar, weather, compliments, and news to be displayed correctly through the software.
- Challenges: I had trouble with creating the mm.sh file to autostart the Magic Mirror, but my instructor Mr. Remston guided me through that. I've also had challenges with the config.js file as well as the OpenWeather API, as it was my first time working with these elements. I worked through the config.js files by instead going through the module folder, rather than editing everything within the config.js file. 
- I plan to put the Raspberry Pi onto a 7 inch IPS display in a frame to complete this project, as well to add more modules and modifications.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.
